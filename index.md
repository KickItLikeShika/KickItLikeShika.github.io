Hi! I'm Ahmed Khaled, an engineer and researcher specializing in AI, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I'm currently a Senior Data Scientist at Cision, following their acquisition of Factmata. where I focus on building and conducting research on Large Scale Machine Learning Models and LLMs.

Also, I'm an Computer Science Master studnet in [Georiga Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/).

I have four years of industry experience. Before joining Factmata, I worked at PyTorch, where I maintained the PyTorch-Ignite library for +8 months.

In my spare time, I participate in Kaggle NLP competitions and have won several medals. 

I'm always looking to connect with others to collaborate on research projects focused on Large Scale Deep Learning and Generative AI. If you would like to collaborate, please reach out!

Hi! I am an engineer and researcher working in AI & Machine Learning. Currently, I am a Senior Data Scientist at Cision (following the acquistion of Factmata), working on building & conducting AI & ML research focused on Large Scale Machine Learning Models and LLMs.

I have 4 years of experience working in the industry. Prior to Factmata, I worked at PyTorch, where I maintained PyTorch-Ignite library for 8 months.

I usually join Kaggle NLP competitons, and I won a couple of medals before. Currently looking for opportunitues where I can connect with people to work on research projects focused on Large Scale Deep Learning and Generative AI.
